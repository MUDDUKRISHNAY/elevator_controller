To simulate all the above file you need open source tool like ->
Icares , gtkwave  # for simulation :
covered # for code coverage :
OpenSTA # for sta :
Yosys # for synthesis :
OpenROAd # for physical design : 

In project I used Nangateopencelllibrary.lib as technology file for synthesis and for physical design I used nangate45(45nm) as technology file
